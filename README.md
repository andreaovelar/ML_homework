### Resampling
#### 1. Oversample the data using the Naive Random Oversampler and SMOTE algorithms.
#### 2. Undersample the data using the Cluster Centroids algorithm.
#### 3. Over- and under-sample using a combination SMOTEENN algorithm.

Use the above to answer the following:

* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
The model with the best balanced accuracy score is SMOTE Oversampling with a value of 0.65
* Which model had the best recall score?
The model with the best best recall score is Naive Random Oversampling with a value of 0.69
* Which model had the best geometric mean score?
The model with the best geometric mean score is SMOTE Oversampling with a value of 0.66


### Ensemble Learning
#### 1. In this section, you will train and compare two different ensemble classifiers to predict loan risk and evaluate each model. You will use the balanced random forest classifier and the easy ensemble AdaBoost classifier.

Use the above to answer the following:

* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
The model with the best balanced accuracy score is EasyEnsembleClassifier with a value of 0.94 
* Which model had the best recall score?
The model with the best recall score is EasyEnsembleClassifier with a value of 0.94 
* Which model had the best geometric mean score?
The model with  the best geometric mean score is EasyEnsembleClassifier with a value of 0.92
* What are the top three features?
The top three features are shown below
